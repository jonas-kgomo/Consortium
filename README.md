> A platform that allows researchers to open-journals and community based journals




##  Open Source


1. Transparency 
2. Fair 
3. No paywall

### Challenges 

- Traditional research publishing which depends on Journals.
-   Journal Rank (impact factor) as a social impact measure is generic
-   Scientific research requires public trust & credibility.
-   Publication in high-ranking journals may distort the communication of scientific progress
-   17010 researchers won’t publish, referee or do editorial work
-   Restrictive access to knowledge is an obstacle to human progress.
-   Redundant libraries
-   Scientific publishers are unnecessary mediators between the members of the scientific and academic community.
-   Pricing Policies and control of copyright, example - Cost of Knowledge

### The Solution
We have topics in both pure research and applied research. The Foundation as well as the larger Ethereum community seek help on both. Typical outputs from researchers are: peer-reviewed academic papers, technical reports, and/or implementations (prototypes as well as production-ready).

## Colored-Papers

white,yellow papers (pre-prints), black and grey papers
    -   A **White paper** is authoritative reports that inform readers in short to understand complex issues, solve problem and make right decision.
    -   A **Yellow paper** is a document containing research that has not yet been formally accepted or published in an academic journal. It is synonymous to the more widely used term preprint.

## The Cost of Knowledge
The Cost of Knowledge is a place for researchers to publicly boycott Elsevier. It was built as a response to Tim Gowers’s call to action, in which he states:

    I am not only going to refuse to have anything to do with Elsevier journals from now on, but I am saying so publicly. I am by no means the first person to do this, but the more of us there are, the more socially acceptable it becomes, and that is my main reason for writing this post.

    It occurs to me that it might help if there were a website somewhere, where mathematicians who have decided not to contribute in any way to Elsevier journals could sign their names electronically. I think that some people would be encouraged to take a stand if they could see that many others were already doing so, and that it would be a good way of making that stand public. Perhaps such a site already exists, in which case I’d like to hear about it and add my name. If it doesn’t, it should be pretty easy to set up, but way beyond my competence I’m afraid. Is there anyone out there who feels like doing it?

Since its launch on January 22, 2012, the boycott has gained extraordinary momentum and has expanded well beyond the initial audience of mathematicians and even beyond the world of academia into mainstream media. Thank you to everyone who has participated in the boycott in any form.

17308 Researchers Taking a Stand. See the list

Academics have protested against Elsevier's business practices for years with little effect. These are some of their objections:

    They charge exorbitantly high prices for subscriptions to individual journals.
    In the light of these high prices, the only realistic option for many libraries is to agree to buy very large "bundles", which will include many journals that those libraries do not actually want. Elsevier thus makes huge profits by exploiting the fact that some of their journals are essential.
    They support measures such as SOPA, PIPA and the Research Works Act, that aim to restrict the free exchange of information.

The key to all these issues is the right of authors to achieve easily-accessible distribution of their work. If you would like to declare publicly that you will not support any Elsevier journal unless they radically change how they operate, then you can do so by filling in your details on this page.

## Elservier and the academic pay-walled journals




## Corum
“In general, so far there has been little emphasis on the distinction between consortium blockchains and fully private blockchains, although it is important: the former provides a hybrid between the ‘low-trust' provided by public blockchains and the ‘single highly-trusted entity' model of private blockchains, whereas the latter can be more accurately described as a traditional centralized system with a degree of cryptographic auditability attached.” Vitalik Buterin
