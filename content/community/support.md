## K-theory Journal

What happened to online articles published in **K-theory** (Springer journal)?


The journal *"K-theory"* used to be published by Springer, but was discontinued after the editorial board resigned around 2007. The editors (or many of them) started the new "Journal of K-theory" in collaboration with Cambridge University Press.


One of the chief editor of the journal noted that
>  *I do regret that it is no longer possible to access the old K-theory papers online*

Maybe I'm being very stupid or missing something obvious, but I am quite sure that articles from "K-theory" used to be available online via Springer, and as far as I can see they are no longer there. Did I miss something here, or did they just disappear? I can't believe Springer would do that, but then I can't find anything by searching, and the article links from MathSciNet are dead:

    Sorry, the page you requested is unavailable. The link you requested might be broken, or no longer exist. SpringerLink is providing researchers with access to millions of scientific documents from Journals, Books, Protocols and Reference works.

In case it helps, here is the journal ISSN: 0920-3036 (print version) 1573-0514 (electronic version).
